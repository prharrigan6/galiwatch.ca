The males are usually first to arrive followed by females a few days or weeks later.\n\nLast year we first caught a male and a female on camera on the same day - March 13^th^ the first day our camera was on.\n\n![](images/paste-D8CAF36B.png)\n\nWe were probably a little late getting going as according to iNaturalist one was spotted on March 9th, 2022 in Ladysmith...\n\nThis year, they had made it to Vashon Island, between Tacoma and Seattle, Washington on March 13th, and yesterday (March 19th) one was seen at a feeder in Richmond Nature Park, BC.\n\nFingers crossed they will be here soon!\n\n<center>![](images/paste-03A8F50B.png){width=\"235\"}</center>\n",
