The first pollinator was a bumble bee caught on camera that afternoon. We collected approximately 850 pics per day (16,000+ pics collected during the observation period) and found only 123 pics with bees in them Â¬-- less than 1%!!\n\nDaily pollinator tally during the flowering period\n\nIn addition to bumble bees we observed a few butterflies and bee flies, as well as other small flies\n\nThis is a template post for the galiwatch blog!\n\nTo make a new post:\n\n1.  copy & rename the template folder\n2.  edit title and date in `index.qmd` of the new directory\n3.  when you're ready to publish, set `draft: false`\n4.  click 'render' (or ctrl + shift + k)\n\nHave fun :))\n\n<center>![](thumbnail.jpg){width=\"20%\"}</center>\n",
