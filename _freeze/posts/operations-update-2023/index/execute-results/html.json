One minute time-lapse photography is insufficient to capture changes in pollinator numbers due to the low number of positive hits. Videoing continually on the other hand is unmanageable in terms of data handling capacity.\n\n-   **Decision taken to take 15s time-lapse pictures for 2022 season with two cameras.**\n\nOccasional gaps in weather and air quality data collection with the enviro-pi occurred during weather-related internet drops.\n\n-   **Decision taken to continue as is**\n\n## Year 2: 2022\n\n### Data collection\n\n-   We successfully collected data at 15 sec intervals throughout the Oregon grape blooming period with two cameras in operation, each focused on a cluster of flower spikes.\n\n-   The enviro-pi weather data collection system was not reliable and started failing in late spring with only patchy PM2.5 data collection attainable. This was replaced by a Purple Air monitor in August 2022. We filled the data gap by accessing data from a neighbouring system on Salt Spring Island approximately 3 km away.\n\n### Lessons learned\n\n15s time-lapse photography produces a manageable data set, but we need some video coverage to determine proportion of bee visits captured by 15s time-lapse pics and inform estimates of total visits.\n\n-   **Decision taken to proceed with 15s time-lapse (two cameras) and video 4 of 5 mins for 5 days mid-way through blooming in 2023.**\n\nThe weather station and Purple Air system for monitoring air quality are very reliable.\n\n-   **Weather data collection to continue as is.**\n\nTraining of a neural network for identifying bees is challenging!\n\n-   **A new strategy for training the neural work to identify bees in time-lapse pics is underway**\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n",
