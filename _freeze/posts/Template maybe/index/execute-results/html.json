The first pollinator was a bumble bee caught on camera that afternoon. We collected approximately 850 pics per day (16,000+ pics collected during the observation period) and found only 123 pics with bees in them. That's less than 1%!!\n\n![](images/Pollinator_tally-02.png)\n\nIn addition to bumble bees we observed a few butterflies and bee flies, as well as other small flies.\n\n## Video footage\n\n<img src=\"images/OG_bee1.gif\" alt=\"bee visiting flower\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 30%; float:left; margin-top:0.2em; margin-right:6px;\"/>\n\nWe collected 4 mins of footage every 5 mins from dawn to dusk from April 21st to May 4th (full bloom to berry set).\n\nThis gave us approx. 175 videos per day for a total of 2,450+ videos collected during the observation period. Around 250 videos (around 10%) had bees in them.\n\nMost bees observed in any one day was 32 on April 22nd.\n\n### Bumble bee ID\n\nWe were able to identify two bumble bee species - Vancouver bumble bees (Bombus vancouverensis) and yellow-fronted bumble bees (Bombus flavifrons).\n\nWe also observed carpenter bees, hover flies (including American thintail), various common-looking flies, small white butterflies (echo azure), slugs, pill bugs, and beetles.\n",
