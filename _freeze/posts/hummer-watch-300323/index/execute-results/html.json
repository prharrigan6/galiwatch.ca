The first rufous hummingbird caught on camera at our feeder in 2023 was a male on Mar 22nd at 7:23pm. The first female was seen 6 days later on Mar 28th at 2:42pm.\n\nThis is a few days later than last year when a male and a female were first detected on the same day, the 18th of March, at 1:13pm and 6:20pm respectively.\n\n![](images/paste-B769CFB3.png)\n\nDetected by the neural network with 100% confidence!!\n",
