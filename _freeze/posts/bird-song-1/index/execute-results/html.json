This little device is now set to collect bird song at our site 24/7.\n\nThe sound files are processed locally on the pi when a sound is detected using BirdNET-pi, which automatically extracts songs and chirps from the recordings, creates spectrograms of each recorded bird sound, stores the data in a database and enables data analysis and visualization.\n\nHere's a summary of the bird songs captured on Apr 21st\n\n![](images/paste-F8901428.png)\n\nAnd some examples of the birds and their calls\n\n![Cooper's hawk\\\n*(Photo: [Simon A](https://inaturalist.ca/people/37277) licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/))*](images/paste-A506767C.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='images/Coopers_Hawk.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![American robin\\\n(*Photo: [Simon A](https://inaturalist.ca/people/37277) licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/))*](images/paste-78A70BD3.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='images/American_Robin.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Red-breasted nuthatch\\\n*(Photo: [Simon A](https://inaturalist.ca/people/37277) licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/))*](images/paste-18A0AE59.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='images/Red-breasted_Nuthatch.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Northern Flicker\\\n*(Photo: [Simon A](https://inaturalist.ca/people/37277) licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/))*](images/paste-14C17AB5.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='images/Northern_Flicker.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Bewick's wren\\\n*(Photo: lornasdr licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/))*](images/paste-C6B829BB.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='images/Bewicks_Wren.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
