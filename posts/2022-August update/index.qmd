Time lapse photography

We used time lapse photography to capture one pic per minute from dawn to dusk from the start to the end of the flowering season (March 12th to May 3rd) The first bee caught on camera flew by before any flowers had opened on the evening of Apr 13th, and we saw open flowers at sunrise on Apr 14th. The first pollinator was a bumble bee caught on camera that afternoon. We collected approximately 850 pics per day (16,000+ pics collected during the observation period) and found only 123 pics with bees in them less than 1%!!

Daily pollinator tally during the flowering period

In addition to bumble bees we observed a few butterflies and bee flies, as well as other small flies
