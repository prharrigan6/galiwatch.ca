# Galiano has just two kinds of frogs!

## Northern Pacific tree frogs (Pseudacris regilla)

These frogs are often bright green, but also come in grey, tan, and brown. They can change colour during the season to better match their environment. The colour change is triggered in response to brightness.

Like most frogs, tree frogs are most active at night, typically resting up in shady, damp spots during the day. At our study site we often find them in or near the plant pots that we water through the dry summer months.

Our infra red time lapse camera caught this one hopping through the salal bushes in the middle of the night.

Tree frogs are also known as Pacific chorus frogs. If you have ever been to Galiano in the spring or early summer - mating season - you will likely know why!!

## Northern red-legged frogs (Rana aurora)

Like tree frogs, the Northern red-legged frogs come in a variety of colours, with their colour depending on age, time of year, and location. These frogs are shyer than the chirpy tree frog, and much less common. They are considered a threatened species on the Provincial blue-list.
