## Seasonal Variations: 2021 versus 2022

[Phenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology) is the study of how the timing of events in a plant's life cycle, such as bud burst, flowering, and fruiting, is affected by seasonal and environmental changes. It is an important field of study for understanding how plants respond to changes in their environment, and can provide insights into how ecosystems may be affected by climate change. [^1]
