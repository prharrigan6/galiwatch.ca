## <center>Exciting news!!</center>

![](images/Birdsong-01.png){width="36"}We have initiated a new wildlife monitoring system - audio moths collecting bird song!!

The audio moth - aka a small microphone - is controlled by a Raspberry pi, which can be powered by USB and connected to a computer via ethernet. This little device is now set to collect bird song at our site 24/7.

The sound files are processed locally on the pi when a sound is detected using BirdNET-pi, which automatically extracts songs and chirps from the recordings, creates spectrograms of each recorded bird sound, stores the data in a database and enables data analysis and visualization.

Here's a summary of the bird songs captured on Apr 21st
